description: Love conquers all in this classic London drawing-room character study.
  Double Harness examines the institution of marriage, exemplified by six British
  couples along with assorted spinsters and bachelors. Idealism, hedonism, worldly
  status, children, and friendships are a few of the elements in this depiction of
  a marriage that comes very near to being a tragedy.
